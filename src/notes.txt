Workflow: 
    1. 
    Generate and train based on basic configurations like a known modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK), 
    a fixed upsampling rate (e.g., 2 SPS), and a random FIR filter with no noise. This will be the 
    baseline for comparison and analysis.
        Random bitstream, BPSK, 2 SPS, random FIR filter, no noise.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, 4 SPS, random FIR filter, low noise.

    2. 
    Increase complexity incrementally by introducing randomness in a signel parameter.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, random SPS, random FIR filter, low noise. 
        Random bitstream, random modulation, 4 SPS, random FIR filter, low noise.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, 4 SPS, random FIR filter, random noise.

    3. 
    Total randomness:
        Random bitstream, random modulation, random SPS, random FIR filter, random noise level.
