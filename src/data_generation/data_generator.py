# Description: This file generates synthetic data for PulseMatch, a model designed to learn and predict pulse shaping functions
#              used in digital communication systems. The process involves the generation of a random bitstream, modulation,
#              upsampling, pulse shaping via FIR filters, and the addition of noise. The generated data is in IQ format (In-phase 
#              and Quadrature), which is commonly used in digital communication systems for representing complex signals.
#
# Rationale:
# The code simulates a simplified signal generation pipeline similar to the transmission chain in digital communication systems.
# It performs the following steps:
#
# 1. Bitstream Generation: A random bitstream is generated to simulate real-world data transmission. The length of the bitstream 
#    varies between 1024 and 65536 bits, corresponding to typical frame sizes used in various communication protocols (e.g., Ethernet, 
#    Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G).
# 
# 2. Modulation: The generated bitstream is modulated using common modulation schemes such as BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, and higher-order 
#    QAM schemes. These modulations are representative of real-world digital communication systems that map bits to symbols in the 
#    complex plane.
#
# 3. Upsampling: The modulated signal is upsampled by a factor of SPS (samples per symbol), which simulates the discretization 
#    process of real-world signals. The upsampling process repeats each symbol over multiple samples, which corresponds to the 
#    concept of increasing the sampling rate to capture more precise information about each symbol. This process is relatively
#    simple. To potentially improve the upsampling process, interpolation methods (e.g., linear, cubic) could be used to create 
#    to more accurately mimic real-world signals.
#
# 4. Pulse Shaping: A finite impulse response (FIR) filter is applied to the upsampled signal to introduce pulse shaping. The 
#    FIR filter generation is done arbitrarily, with the random creation of completely random taps and potentially known pulse 
#    shaping filters (e.g., RRC, RC, Gaussian, Sinc). The logic behind FIR Filter generation is as follows:
#
#    - The number of taps for the FIR filter is an integer multiple of the samples per symbol (SPS) to align with the symbol period.
#    - Randomly, either a known filter (e.g., RRC, RC, Gaussian, Sinc) is selected or a completely random FIR filter is generated to 
#      balance the dataset between known and unknown filters.
#    - Random windowing functions (e.g., Hamming, Hanning, etc.) are applied to the generated taps to simulate practical filter 
#      characteristics. Windowing smooths the filterâ€™s impulse response, reducing side lobes and controlling spectral leakage.
#    - Finally, normalization is applied to the filter taps to ensure that the filter has a unit energy, making it similar to 
#      real-world pulse shaping filters, which ensures proper signal power and avoids distortion.
#
# 5. Noise Application: Noise, modeled as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), is introduced to simulate real-world channel impairments. 
#    The noise level can be adjusted to represent different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The addition of AWGN, similary to the sps process
#    is relatively simple. To potentially improve the noise application process, more complex noise models (e.g., Rayleigh, Rician)
#
# Notes:
# - Time: 
#   - The code does not explicitly incorporate a time axis. Instead, the data is represented purely in 
#     IQ format, with each symbol mapped to a set number of samples (SPS). This reflects the typical signal representation in digital 
#     communication systems, where signals are sampled at discrete time intervals without a direct time reference.
#   
# - IQ Representation: 
#   - The IQ format is a standard in digital communications where the signal is represented by two orthogonal 
#     components: the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. These components carry the encoded information and are used to 
#     represent complex-valued signals.
#
# - Theoretical Alignment:
#   - In theory, digital communication systems rely on a combination of modulation schemes, pulse shaping, and noise modeling 
#     to encode and transmit information efficiently and accurately. This code attempts to accurately reflect that pipeline
#     Through the previously mentioned process. While the time axis is not explicitly included in the implementation, this 
#     concern is addressed, as the symbol rate and sampling rates are implicitly accounted for.
#
# - Limitations: 
#   - While this approach mimics the key theoretical components of digital communication, the absence 
#     of an explicit time axis means that the symbol rate is not directly/explicitly represented as a time interval. Instead, the data is sampled 
#     based on the SPS rate. In real systems, time and symbol rate are used to align the transmitted signal with a receiver's 
#     sampling process. However, for training a model to learn pulse shaping functions, I believe this approach is sufficient,
#     as the focus of PulseMatch is to determine if a machine learning model can learn any arbitrary pulse shaping function given
#     different modulation schemes, upsampling rates, and noise levels and not necessarily about receiver alignment.
