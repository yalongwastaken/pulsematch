Workflow: 
    1. Generate and train based on basic configurations like a known modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK) and
    set noise level.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, random/known FIR filter, no noise.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, random/known FIR filter, low noise.
        Random bitstream, 32QAM, random/known FIR filter, low noise.

    2. Increase complexity incrementally by introducing randomness.
        Random bitstream, random modulation, random/known FIR filter, low noise.
        Random bitstream, known modulation, random/known FIR filter, random noise.

    3. Total randomness:
        Random bitstream, random modulation, random/known FIR filter, random noise.

Note: When generating the filters, the known FIR filters (e.g., RRC, Sinc) do not rely on random SPS (samples per symbol)
or random windowing functions. Instead, they inherently incorporate randomness based on the randomly selected bitrate and
sampling rate. Additionally, the ratio of completely random FIR filters to known FIR filters will be 0.75, meaning that 75% 
of the filters will be entirely random, while the remaining 25% will be based on known filter designs.
