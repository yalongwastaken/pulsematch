Workflow: 
    1. 
    Generate and train based on basic configurations like a known modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK), 
    a fixed upsampling rate (e.g., 2 SPS), and a random FIR filter with no noise. This will be the 
    baseline for comparison and analysis.
        Random bitstream, BPSK, 2 SPS, random FIR filter, no noise.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, 4 SPS, random FIR filter, low noise.

    2. 
    Increase complexity incrementally by introducing randomness in a signel parameter.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, random SPS, random FIR filter, low noise. 
        Random bitstream, random modulation, 4 SPS, random FIR filter, low noise.
        Random bitstream, 8PSK, 4 SPS, random FIR filter, random noise.

    3. 
    Total randomness:
        Random bitstream, random modulation, random SPS, random FIR filter, random noise level.


Loss Function: 
    L = (lambda) * (Loss Power Ratio) + (1 - lambda) * (Loss MSE)
        : Loss Power Ratio : 
            1. Ideal Signal Power = Power(Actual FIR Filter Taps * Noisy Input Signal)
            2. Predicted Signal Power = Power(Predicted FIR Filter Taps * Noisy Input Signal)
            3. Loss Power Ratio = | (Ideal Signal Power)/(Predicted Signal Power) - 1| ** 2
        : Loss Mean Squared Error :
            1. Loss MSE = (Actual FIR Filter Taps - Predicted Filter Taps) ** 2 / # of Taps
